# Backend Documentation

The backend of the application is built using [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/), a Python framework for asynchronous web applications. The backend code is stored in the [``app/backend``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend") folder. The frontend and backend communicate using the [AI Chat App HTTP Protocol](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-chat-app-protocol).

## Directory Structure

The [``app/backend``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend") directory contains the following key files and directories:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the backend application. It initializes the Quart app and sets up the routes.
- `approaches/`: This directory contains the classes powering the Chat and Ask tabs. Each class uses a different RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions and classes that are used across the application.

## Key Components

### Chat and Ask Approaches

The primary backend code you'll want to customize is the [``app/backend/approaches``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%2Fapproaches%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend\approaches") folder, which contains the classes powering the Chat and Ask tabs. Each class uses a different RAG approach, which include system messages that should be changed to match your data.

#### Chat Approach

The chat tab uses the approach programmed in [`chatreadretrieveread.py`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22app%2Fbackend%2Fapproaches%2Fchatreadretrieveread.py%22%2C%22chatreadretrieveread.py%22%5D "app/backend/approaches/chatreadretrieveread.py"). It calls the OpenAI ChatCompletion API to turn the user question into a good search query, queries Azure AI Search for search results for that query, and then combines the search results and original user question to answer the question based on the sources.

### Utility Functions

The `utils/` directory contains utility functions and classes that are used across the application. These include functions for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with external services.

## Running the Backend

To run the backend, navigate to the [``app/backend``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend") directory and execute the following command:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

This will start the Quart server and the backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Customizing the Backend

You can customize the backend by modifying the code in the [``app/backend/approaches``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%2Fapproaches%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend\approaches") directory. For example, you can change the `system_message_chat_conversation` variable in [`chatreadretrieveread.py`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22app%2Fbackend%2Fapproaches%2Fchatreadretrieveread.py%22%2C%22chatreadretrieveread.py%22%5D "app/backend/approaches/chatreadretrieveread.py") to match your data.

github-cloudlabsuser-535: did u create a file? can us tore this in app/backend/README

GitHub Copilot: I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to directly create or modify files in your local or remote environment. However, you can manually create a README.md file in your `app/backend` directory and copy the provided documentation into that file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the `app/backend` directory in your project.
2. Create a new file named `README.md`.
3. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor.
4. Copy the provided documentation and paste it into the `README.md` file.
5. Save the `README.md` file.

This will create a README.md file in your `app/backend` directory with the provided documentation.
